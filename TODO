
* Refactor the setup.cmd script. It is working very well, but
it is based on an old structure and nomenclature. Use structure
and nomenclature based on the win-msvc tool
(https://github.com/tools-library/win-msvc).

* Add an argument indicating that changes made to the 'PATH'
environment variable should not be exported. The main reason
for this is that we could use this tool with minimal impact
on the system's environment variables. That way, when we are
going to use this tool, we can find them based on the exported
environment variable 'TOOLSET_GIT_PATH'.
