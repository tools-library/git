        After running the setup.cmd, with the appropriate
        arguments, the tool will be available in the system
        path.

TOOL   : GIT
VERSION: 2.27.0.windows.1
ARCH   : x64

USAGE:
    setup.cmd {-h|--help|--pack|--unpack | [--mode 1|2|3|4]
        [--home-path path/to/home]}

EXAMPLES:
    setup.cmd
    setup.cmd -h
    setup.cmd --pack
    setup.cmd --mode 3
    setup.cmd --mode 2 --home-path "/home/user"
    setup.cmd --mode 4 --home-path "c:/my/home/user"

ARGUMENTS:
    -h|--help    Print this help and exit.

    --pack    Pack the content of the software folder in one
        self-extract executable called 'software.exe'.

    --unpack    Unpack the self-extract executable 'software.exe'
        to the software folder.

    --mode    When 1, we will have access to the following commands
        in our windows cmd prompt - 'git-bash' and 'git-cmd'.

        When 2, we will have access to all commands of the 'mode 1'
        plus the following commands - 'git', 'git-gui' and 'gitk'.

        When 3, we will have access to all commands of the 'mode 1'
        plus the following commands - 'bash', 'git' and 'sh'.

        When 4, we will have access to all commands of the 'mode 1'
        and the following paths of 'msysgit' will be added to the
        system path - '/mingw64/bin', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin',
        '/usr/bin/vendor_perl' and '/usr/bin/core_perl'. With this
        we will have access to a lot of unix tools right in the
        windows cmd prompt. OBS: Use this with care!

    --home-path    Path where the 'home' folder, for the git config
        files, will be located. If not specified, the 'home' folder
        will be defaulted to the following location
        '[drive]:/Users/[user]/'. Example: 'C:/Users/BillGates/'.
        This argument must be a valid path to a folder in windows
        or 'msysgit' and must have no spaces in it. If the path
        does not exist, it will be created.

EXPORTED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    TOOLSET_GIT_PATH    Absolute path where this tool is
        located.

    PATH    This tool will export all local changes that it made to
        the path's environment variable.

    The environment variables will be exported only if this tool
    executes without any error.
